## OneYes App

If there’s something you really want, that that you keep trying to get, don’t be afraid to hear “No”

To change your perception, imagine if I told you that you would be told no 25 times. You tried or asked once, and got told no. How eager would you be to try again and get your second no? Your third? The count is imaginary but can still be a powerful motivator when you realize a yes is nestled in there somewhere, and you’re going to find it. This app allows you to track where it was and your journey to it.

When you reach for success, sometimes all it takes is one “Yes”
